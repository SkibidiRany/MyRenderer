	add:   DONE
	FIX DRAWING RECTANGLE INSTEAD OF TEXT BUG. DONE
	
1 	Add rotating using right mouse button.   	DONE


1 	This came back again"	FIX DRAWING RECTANGLE INSTEAD OF TEXT BUG. DONE", but this time it is only for DRAWING THE COORDS OF POINTS in shapes deriving from shape class.
					this is weird, I don't have time to look through it now. will need to fix it later.   DONE


1 	FIX: On left mouse button hold, all other points (NOT including Points deriving from shape class) change their color to the last color we got from the RGB inputs.  DONE


0	The code Needs HEAVY reactoring, it works but it is getting closer to being spaghetti, here is the architecture I am thinking about currently:
					# Global parameters in Utilities.h
					# Base functions in myFunctions.h
					# Base classes and interfaces in myClasses.h
					# InputFields.h and InputFields.cpp as is

1	Add flush screen drawings button. DONE
