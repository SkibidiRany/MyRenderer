TODO : 
- Add Input Field inheritance.   I don't want to add this
- ADD THREADS TO DRAWING LOGIC TO BOOST PERFORMANCE.  	FAILED - no can do


- Add text on midpoint functionality:
	add:   DONE
	FIX DRAWING RECTANGLE INSTEAD OF TEXT BUG. DONE
	
- Add rotating using right mouse button.   	DONE


--------- This came back again"	FIX DRAWING RECTANGLE INSTEAD OF TEXT BUG. DONE", but this time it is only for DRWAING THE COORDS OF POINTS in shapes deriving from shape class.
					 this is weird, I don't have time to look through it now. will need to fix it later.


- The code Needs HEAVY reactoring, it works but it is getting closer to being spaghetti, here is the architecture I am thinking about currently:
					# Global parameters in Utilities.h
					# Base functions in myFunctions.h
					# Base classes and interfaces in myClasses.h
					# InputFields.h and InputFields.cpp as is
